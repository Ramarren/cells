;; here we look at just one problem, what i call dataflow interference. consider
;; a dependency graph underlying:
;;
;;     - a depends on b and c, and...
;;     - b depends on c
;;
;; if c changes, depending on the accident of the order in which a and b happened to
;; be first evaluated, a might appear before b on c's list of dependents (callers). then the
;; following happens:
;;
;;     - c triggers a
;;     - a calculates off the new value of c and an obsolete cached value for b
;;     - a outputs an invalid value and triggers any dependents, all of whom recalculate
;;         using a's invalid value
;;     - c triggers b
;;     - b recalculates and then triggers a, which then recalculates correctly and outputs and triggers
;;         the rest of the df graph back into line
;;
;; the really bad news is that outputs go outside the model: what if the invalid output caused
;; a missile launch? sure, a subsequent correct calculation comes along shortly, but
;; irrevocable damage may have been done.
