;;; note:  we use boiler2 and thermometer from example 2 in example 3,
;;; along with their def-output methods defined in example 2.
;;;
;;; also: these do not use ct-assert to perform automatic testing, but
;;; they do illustrate a possible real-world application of synapses. to
;;; observe the difference made by synapses, one must look at the trace output
;
; now let's look at synapses, which mediate a dependency between two cells.
; the example here has an input argument (sensitivity-enabled) which when
; enables gives the temp cell an (fsensitivity 0.05) clause.

; the example simulates a thermometer perhaps
; malfunctioning which is sending streams of values randomly plus or minus
; two-hundredths of a degree. does not sound serious, except...
;
; if you run the example as is, when the temperature gets to our on/off threshhold
; of 100, chances are you will see the boiler toggle itself on and off several times
; before the temperature moves away from 100.
;
; building maintenance personel will report this odd behavior, probably hearing the
; vent open and shut and open again several times in quick succession.

; the problem is traced to the cell rule which reacts too slavishly to the stream
; of temperature values. a work order is cut to replace the thermometer, and to reprogram
; the controller not to be so slavish. there are lots of ways to solve this; here if
; you enable sensitivity by running example 4 you can effectively place a synapse between the
; temperature cell of the thermometer and the status cell of the boiler which
; does not even trigger the status cell unless the received value differs by the
; specified amount from the last value which was actually relayed.

; now the boiler simply cuts off as the temperature passes 100, and stays off even if
; the thermometer temperature goes to 99.98. the trace output shows that although the temperature
; of the thermometer is changing, only occasionally does the rule to decide the boiler
; status get kicked off.
