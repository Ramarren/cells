#| Synapse Cell Unification Notes

- start by making Cells synapse-y

- make sure outputs show right old and new values
- make sure outputs fire when they should

- wow: test the Cells II dictates: no output callback sees stale data, no rule
sees stale data, etc etc

- test a lot of different synapses

- make sure they fire when they should, and do not when they should not

- make sure they survive an evaluation by the caller which does not branch to
them (ie, does not access them)

- make sure they optimize away

- test with forms which access multiple other cells

- look at direct alteration of a caller

- does SETF honor not propagating, as well as a c-ruled after re-calcing

- do diff unchanged tests such as string-equal work
