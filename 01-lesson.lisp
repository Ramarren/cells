;;; The first thing we see is that we are not creating something new, we are
;;; merely /extending/ CLOS. defmodel works like defclass in all ways, except for
;;; extensions to provide the behavior of Cells. We see both :initform
;;; and :default-initarg used to provide rules for a slot. We also see
;;; the initarg :len used to override the default initform.
;;;
;;; By extending defclass we (a) retain its expressiveness, and (b) produce
;;; something hopefully easier to learn by developers already familiar with CLOS.
;;;
;;; The first extension we see is that the len initform refers to the
;;; Smalltalk-like anaphoric variable self, to which will be bound
;;; the rectangle instance being initialized. Normally an initform is evaluated
;;; without being able to see the instance, and any initialization requiring
;;; that must be done in the class initializer.
