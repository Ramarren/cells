    ; OLD THINKING, preserved for the record, but NO LONGER TRUE:
    ;  we do not go back to check for a need to :tell-dependents because (a) the original propagation
    ; and processing of the :tell-dependents queue is a full propagation; no rule can ask for a cell that
    ; then decides it needs to recompute and possibly propagate; and (b) the only rules forced awake during
    ; awakening need that precisely because no one asked for their values, so there can be no dependents
    ; to "tell". I think. :) So...
    ; END OF OLD THINKING
    ;
    ; We now allow :awaken to change things so more dependents need to be told. The problem is the implicit
    ; dependence on the /life/ of a model whenever there is a dependence on any /cell/ of that model.
    ; md-quiesce currently just flags such slots as uncurrent -- maybe /that/ should change and those should
    ; recalculate at once -- and then an /observer/ can run and ask for a new value from such an uncurrent cell,
    ; which now knows it must recalculate. And that recalculation of course can and likely will come up with a new value
    ; and perforce need to tell its dependents. So...
    ;
    ; I /could/ explore something other than the "uncurrent" kludge, but NCTM 2007 is coming up and
    ; to be honest the idea of not allowing nested tells was enforcing a /guess/ that that should not
    ; arise, and there was not even any perceived integrity whole being closed, it was just a gratuitous
    ; QA trick, and indeed for a long time many nested tells were avoidable. But the case of the quiesced
    ; dependent reverses the arrow and puts the burden on the prosecution to prove nested tells are a problem.

    ; run. deep-cells looks to behave just right, but maybe a tougher test will present a problem?
